# JODDB Flutter Task

This Flutter project was developed as part of the application process for the Flutter Developer position at **JODDB**.

## 📱 Overview

The app demonstrates key features often used in production Flutter applications, including:

- Firebase Authentication
- Local data storage
- State management using BLoC

## 🧠 State Management

This project uses the **BLoC** pattern to manage app state. BLoC provides a clear separation between business logic and UI, making the app more scalable and maintainable.

## 🗄️ Local Database

Local data is stored using **Hive**, a lightweight and blazing fast key-value database written in pure Dart. Hive was chosen for its excellent performance and seamless integration with Flutter.

## 🔐 Authentication

User authentication is handled via **Firebase Authentication**, offering a secure and robust login system.
